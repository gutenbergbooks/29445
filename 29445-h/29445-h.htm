<h1><big>THE HOUR<br />
OF BATTLE</big></h1>

<h2>BY ROBERT SHECKLEY</h2>

<p class="p1">ILLUSTRATED BY KRENKEL</p>

<div class="bk1"><p><big>As one of the Guardian ships protecting Earth, the
crew had a problem to solve. Just how do you protect
a race from an enemy who can take over a man's mind
without seeming effort or warning?</big></p></div>

<p>"That hand didn't move, did
it?" Edwardson asked, standing
at the port, looking at the
stars.</p>

<p>"No," Morse said. He had
been staring fixedly at the
Attison Detector for over an
hour. Now he blinked three
times rapidly, and looked again.
"Not a millimeter."</p>

<p>"I don't think it moved
either," Cassel added, from behind
the gunfire panel. And that
was that. The slender black hand
of the indicator rested unwaveringly
on zero. The ship's guns
were ready, their black mouths
open to the stars. A steady hum
filled the room. It came from the
Attison Detector, and the sound
was reassuring. It reinforced
the fact that the Detector was
attached to all the other Detectors,
forming a gigantic network
around Earth.</p>

<p>"Why in hell don't they
come?" Edwardson asked, still
looking at the stars. "Why don't
they hit?"</p>

<p>"Aah, shut up," Morse said.
He had a tired, glum look. High
on his right temple was an old
radiation burn, a sunburst of
pink scar tissue. From a distance
it looked like a decoration.</p>

<p>"I just wish they'd come,"
Edwardson said. He returned
from the port to his chair, bending
to clear the low metal ceiling.
"Don't you wish they'd
come?" Edwardson had the narrow,
timid face of a mouse; but
a highly intelligent mouse. One
that cats did well to avoid.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="361" height="550" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>"Don't you?" he repeated.</p>

<p>The other men didn't answer.
They had settled back to their
dreams, staring hypnotically at
the Detector face.</p>

<p>"They've had enough time,"
Edwardson said, half to himself.</p>

<p>Cassel yawned and licked his
lips. "Anyone want to play some
gin?" he asked, stroking his
beard. The beard was a memento
of his undergraduate days.
Cassel maintained he could store
almost fifteen minutes worth of
oxygen in its follicles. He had
never stepped into space unhelmeted
to prove it.</p>

<p>Morse looked away, and Edwardson
automatically watched
the indicator. This routine had
been drilled into them, branded
into their subconscious. They
would as soon have cut their
throats as leave the indicator unguarded.</p>

<p>"Do you think they'll come
soon?" Edwardson asked, his
brown rodent's eyes on the indicator.
The men didn't answer
him. After two months together
in space their conversational
powers were exhausted. They
weren't interested in Cassel's
undergraduate days, or in
Morse's conquests.</p>

<p>They were bored to death even
with their own thoughts and
dreams, bored with the attack
they expected momentarily.</p>

<p>"Just one thing <i>I'd</i> like to
know," Edwardson said, slipping
with ease into an old conversational
gambit. "How far can
they do it?"</p>

<p>They had talked for weeks
about the enemy's telepathic
range, but they always returned
to it.</p>

<p>As professional soldiers, they
couldn't help but speculate on
the enemy and his weapons.
It was their shop talk.</p>

<p>"Well," Morse said wearily,
"Our Detector network covers
the system out beyond Mars' orbit."</p>

<p>"Where we sit," Cassel said,
watching the indicators now that
the others were talking.</p>

<p>"They might not even know
we have a detection unit working,"
Morse said, as he had said
a thousand times.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop," Edwardson said,
his thin face twisted in scorn.
"They're telepathic. They must
have read every bit of stuff in
Everset's mind."</p>

<p>"Everset didn't know we had
a detection unit," Morse said,
his eyes returning to the dial.
"He was captured before we had
it."</p>

<p>"Look," Edwardson said,
"They ask him, 'Boy, what
would you do if you knew a telepathic
race was coming to take
over Earth? How would you
guard the planet?'"</p>

<p>"Idle speculation," Cassel
said. "Maybe Everset didn't
think of this."</p>

<p>"He thinks like a man, doesn't
he? Everyone agreed on this
defense. Everset would, too."</p>

<p>"Syllogistic," Cassel murmured.
"Very shaky."</p>

<p>"I sure wish he hadn't been
captured," Edwardson said.</p>

<p>"It could have been worse,"
Morse put in, his face sadder
than ever. "What if they'd captured
<i>both</i> of them?"</p>

<p>"I wish they'd come," Edwardson
said.</p>

<hr />

<p>Richard Everset and C. R.
Jones had gone on the first interstellar
flight. They had
found an inhabited planet in
the region of Vega. The rest
was standard procedure.</p>

<p>A flip of the coin had decided
it. Everset went down in the
scouter, maintaining radio contact
with Jones, in the ship.</p>

<p>The recording of that contact
was preserved for all Earth to
hear.</p>

<p>"Just met the natives," Everset
said. "Funny-looking bunch.
Give you the physical description
later."</p>

<p>"Are they trying to talk to
you?" Jones asked, guiding the
ship in a slow spiral over the
planet.</p>

<p>"No. Hold it. Well I'm
damned! They're telepathic!
How do you like that?"</p>

<p>"Great," Jones said. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Hold it. Say, Jonesy, I don't
know as I like these boys. They
haven't got nice minds. Brother!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" Jones asked,
lifting the ship a little higher.</p>

<p>"Minds! These bastards are
power-crazy. Seems they've hit
all the systems around here,
looking for someone to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeh?"</p>

<p>"I've got that a bit wrong,"
Everset said pleasantly. "They
are not so bad."</p>

<p>Jones had a quick mind, a suspicious
nature and good reflexes.
He set the accelerator for all the
G's he could take, lay down on
the floor and said, "Tell me
more."</p>

<p>"Come on down," Everset
said, in violation of every law
of spaceflight. "These guys are
all right. As a matter of fact,
they're the most marvelous&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was where the recording
ended, because Jones was pinned
to the floor by twenty G's acceleration
as he boosted the ship
to the level needed for the C-jump.</p>

<p>He broke three ribs getting
home, but he got there.</p>

<p>A telepathic species was on
the march. What was Earth going
to do about it?</p>

<p>A lot of speculation necessarily
clothed the bare bones of
Jones' information. Evidently
the species could take over a
mind with ease. With Everset,
it seemed that they had insinuated
their thoughts into his,
delicately altering his previous
convictions. They had possessed
him with remarkable ease.</p>

<p>How about Jones? Why hadn't
they taken him? Was distance
a factor? Or hadn't they been
prepared for the suddenness of
his departure?</p>

<p>One thing was certain. Everything
Everset knew, the enemy
knew. That meant they knew
where Earth was, and how defenseless
the planet was to their
form of attack.</p>

<p>It could be expected that they
were on their way.</p>

<p>Something was needed to
nullify their tremendous advantage.
But what sort of something?
What armor is there
against thought? How do you
dodge a wavelength?</p>

<p>Pouch-eyed scientists gravely
consulted their periodic tables.</p>

<p>And how do you know when
a man has been possessed? Although
the enemy was clumsy
with Everset, would they continue
to be clumsy? Wouldn't
they learn?</p>

<p>Psychologists tore their hair
and bewailed the absence of an
absolute scale for humanity.</p>

<p>Of course, something had to
be done at once. The answer,
from a technological planet, was
a technological one. Build a
space fleet and equip it with
some sort of a detection-fire network.</p>

<p>This was done in record time.
The Attison Detector was developed,
a cross between radar
and the electroencephalograph.
Any alteration from the typical human
brain wave pattern of
the occupants of a Detector-equipped
ship would boost the
indicator around the dial. Even
a bad dream or a case of indigestion
would jar it.</p>

<p>It seemed probable that any
attempt to take over a human
mind would disturb something.
There had to be a point of interaction,
somewhere.</p>

<p>That was what the Attison
Detector was supposed to detect.
Maybe it would.</p>

<p>The spaceships, three men to
a ship, dotted space between
Earth and Mars, forming a gigantic
sphere with Earth in the
center.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of men
crouched behind gunfire panels,
watching the dials on the Attison
Detector.</p>

<p>The unmoving dials.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Do you think I could fire a
couple of bursts?" Edwardson
asked, his fingers on the gunfire
button. "Just to limber the
guns?"</p>

<p>"Those guns don't need limbering,"
Cassel said, stroking
his beard. "Besides, you'd throw
the whole fleet into a panic."</p>

<p>"Cassel," Morse said, very
quietly. "Get your hand off your
beard."</p>

<p>"Why should I?" Cassel
asked.</p>

<p>"Because," Morse answered,
almost in a whisper, "I am about
to ram it right down your fat
throat."</p>

<p>Cassel grinned and tightened
his fists. "Pleasure," he said.
"I'm tired of looking at that
scar of yours." He stood up.</p>

<p>"Cut it," Edwardson said
wearily. "Watch the birdie."</p>

<p>"No reason to, really," Morse
said, leaning back. "There's an
alarm bell attached." But he
looked at the dial.</p>

<p>"What if the bell doesn't
work?" Edwardson asked.
"What if the dial is jammed?
How would you like something
cold slithering into your mind?"</p>

<p>"The dial'll work," Cassel
said. His eyes shifted from Edwardson's
face to the motionless
indicator.</p>

<p>"I think I'll sack in," Edwardson
said.</p>

<p>"Stick around," Cassel said.
"Play you some gin."</p>

<p>"All right." Edwardson found
and shuffled the greasy cards,
while Morse took a turn glaring
at the dial.</p>

<p>"I sure wish they'd come," he
said.</p>

<p>"Cut," Edwardson said, handing
the pack to Cassel.</p>

<p>"I wonder what our friends
look like," Morse said, watching
the dial.</p>

<p>"Probably remarkably like
us," Edwardson said, dealing
the cards. Cassel picked them
up one by one, slowly, as if he
hoped something interesting
would be under them.</p>

<p>"They should have given us
another man," Cassel said. "We
could play bridge."</p>

<p>"I don't play bridge," Edwardson
said.</p>

<p>"You could learn."</p>

<p>"Why didn't we send a task
force?" Morse asked. "Why didn't
we bomb their planet?"</p>

<p>"Don't be dumb," Edwardson
said. "We'd lose any ship we
sent. Probably get them back at
us, possessed and firing."</p>

<p>"Knock with nine," Cassel
said.</p>

<p>"I don't give a good damn if
you knock with a thousand," Edwardson
said gaily. "How much
do I owe you now?"</p>

<p>"Three million five hundred
and eight thousand and ten.
Dollars."</p>

<p>"I sure wish they'd come,"
Morse said.</p>

<p>"Want me to write a check?"</p>

<p>"Take your time. Take until
next week."</p>

<p>"Someone should reason with
the bastards," Morse said, looking
out the port. Cassel immediately
looked at the dial.</p>

<p>"I just thought of something,"
Edwardson said.</p>

<p>"Yeh?"</p>

<p>"I bet it feels horrible to have
your mind grabbed," Edwardson
said. "I bet it's awful."</p>

<p>"You'll know when it happens,"
Cassel said.</p>

<p>"Did Everset?"</p>

<p>"Probably. He just couldn't
do anything about it."</p>

<p>"My mind feels fine," Cassel
said. "But the first one of you
guys starts acting queer&mdash;watch
out."</p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>"Well," Edwardson said, "I'd
sure like a chance to reason with
them. This is stupid."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Cassel asked.</p>

<p>"You mean go out and meet
<i>them</i>?"</p>

<p>"Sure," Cassel said. "We're
doing no good sitting here."</p>

<p>"I should think we could do
something," Edwardson said
slowly. "After all, they're not invincible.
They're reasoning beings."</p>

<p>Morse punched a course on
the ship's tape, then looked
up.</p>

<p>"You think we should contact
the command? Tell them what
we're doing?"</p>

<p>"No!" Cassel said, and Edwardson
nodded in agreement.
"Red tape. We'll just go out and
see what we can do. If they
won't talk, we'll blast 'em out
of space."</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>Out of the port they could see
the red flare of a reaction engine;
the next ship in their sector,
speeding forward.</p>

<p>"They must have got the same
idea," Edwardson said.</p>

<p>"Let's get there first," Cassel
said. Morse shoved the accelerator
in and they were thrown
back in their seats.</p>

<p>"That dial hasn't moved yet,
has it?" Edwardson asked, over
the clamor of the Detector alarm
bell.</p>

<p>"Not a move out of it," Cassel
said, looking at the dial with
its indicator slammed all the way
over to the highest notch.</p>
